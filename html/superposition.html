    <h1><strong>Superposition</strong></h1>
    <hr
<body>
    <p>Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured. Because the concept is difficult to understand, this essential principle of quantum mechanics is often illustrated by an experiment carried out in 1801 by the English physicist, Thomas Young.



        Why I was drawn to mathematics: its truths seemed eternal. Why I've focused on physics: its truths speak to reality.
