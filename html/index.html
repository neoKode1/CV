    <p>Entropy  

        The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy.
        
        Entropy is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty.</p> 
        <p>I would have conversations with people and would realize that everybody’s not even on the same intelligence level as you. This is because every person has a different level of educational growth, experiences that reinforces that knowledge that overtime yields different interpretations of outcomes. To have a Intelligent conversation with someone,both parties should be versed on the subject, through one of the parties could be informed by the other party through debate and discussion and at the end of conversation you are supposed to be enlightened. So at the end of any conversation that you don’t feel like you’ve gained anything or that that was a waste of your time, those are the conversations I’m speaking about. For instance,  if a person is saying  “I don’t vote because I don’t change anything and nothings ever going to change”.  that person may be without some information to make informed choices when they go about talking about a subject. Emotions aren’t real.  



            As Pert explained in her earlier book, Molecules of Emotion, neurotransmitters called peptides carry emotional messages. These messages change the chemistry of our body's cells. ... The electrical signals in our brains and bodies affect the way cells interact and function.
            
            Emotions are chemical byproducts and imbalances in the brain and neural structure within neural sequences that overtime do not function as well or as easy as they did or have been in the past.  I’ve struggled a lot with my anger my whole life even now, The mouth is an interface between emotion and occurrence. the source of my frustration COMES FROM ME, no one else.  No one can make you angry. People don’t care if you suffer. Suffering in the local. Your whole reality is local that’s why no one can agree on the time. Let alone the truth. One morning I was watching morning Joe and the cohost Mika Brzezinski</p>
