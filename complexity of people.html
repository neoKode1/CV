        <p><strong>Entropy</a></strong> The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy.
            
            Entropy is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty.</p>
        <p>People are very complex. The same way a person can wrong you, you could wrong another person. only thing that changes is perspective. Example we‚Äôve all had someone who‚Äôs in a car behind us ride to close to our trail reversely we‚Äôve also been that same person riding too close to someone tail, the perspective in which you seen yourself being wronged could be felt the same way to the person that you wronged, or might not be feltü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The human world is hypocritical so much so that that is the only place where that word even exist. A lion doesn‚Äôt know the word hypocrite when hyenas attack.  My mom helped me my whole life. Maybe because she was from the old guard, she genuinely loves me. One of the few references of love I‚Äôve known. 

            People were all wrong about the sexes. I don‚Äôt think people realize how complex the world is. You could have a family and two siblings mother and father one sibling can grow up and believe that mother and father are the greatest human beings I‚Äôve ever known in the same family the other sibling to grow up and believe he had the worst parent ever. let me say it is I don‚Äôt think parents owe children anything. In our society we come up with norms and behaviors that suit the society, if there is any emergent type of destructive behavior, society as a whole get pushed to the fringes, the edges of society. The fringes, people who may be spiritual, people who believe in abstract realities maybe there are extremes on both sides of the ideological spectrum.
            
            I was watching a podcast with Lex Fridman Podcast about complexity with Stephen wolfram, by the end of the podcast I understood what basically the nature of complexity really means from different frames of reference. what is that when we have these conversations with people we have conversations all willy-nilly with people who don‚Äôt even have the same level of knowledge. Is it the human connection. school has failed us so badly. But then again it was never about education it was about control. I want to say that this is an emergent feature of a society I believe. but the human being. humans that‚Äôs all it is. we are another functionally entity in this whole scheme of the cosmos.  Karma means nothing.</p>
